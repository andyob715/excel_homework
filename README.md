### Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?

1. Looking at the category pivot, if you want to the best chance to have a succesful campaign, submit a music campaign. Music has the greatest proportion of successful campaigns.
2. Based on the subcategory pivot, the US generates around 3x more succesful campaigns than the rest of the countries combined. This is most likely due to popularity of the service in the US.
3. From the bonus stats sheets, Successful projects generate a signficantly higher backer population than non-succesful. That popularity means they have a lower per backer donation required to be succesful.

### What are some limitations of the dataset?

1. There is no way to determine whether the campaigns are all from unique contributors or whether there are "kickstarter factories" that can perpetually turn out succesful campaigns. Knowing percentage of repeat successors vs. unique successors could be potentially illuminating.
2. Other than the SPOTLIGHT column we have no data to support outside influence impact on campaigns. If we had marketing/web traffic stats or page hits that may drive more insight.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs we could create

1. We could compare average backer contribution to Kickstarter state. Determine whether larger backer contributions lead to more succesful campaigns.
2. We could use staff pick and spotlight fields to see whether those have a higher successs rate compared to non-staff picks and spotlight fields
3. We could compare YoY or QoQ for each category to see whether there is trendng on success for certain categories
